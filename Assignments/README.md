### Python Assignment Questions

This directory contains two parts i.e. Conditional Statements and For Loops. Both these are building blocks of programming concepts. 

These are the books I used to learn and practice these concepts:

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Way-Learn-Python-Remember/dp/1974431479">Smarter Way to Learn Python: # Learn it faster. Remember it longer by Mark Myers</a>

The book is structured with short, digestible chapters that focus on building small concepts. I learned and practiced syntax through each chapter, and the exercises at the end of every section helped me reinforce and improve my understanding of the material. This book had had 4-6 chapters for a small concept i.e if it taught conditionals i had 7 chapters that really taught me in detail.

After learning and practicing syntax from the first book, I delved deeper into the concepts and theories with this one. It significantly strengthened my programming skills and taught me how to think like a programmer. The book’s practical approach was more detailed than the previous one, and I made sure to take notes in the Obsidian app to reinforce my learning. Mind you Obsidian really is better than many note taking apps and it's better than making notes on register that you would never check again. Here's a guide to obsidian if you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88

1. **Write a program that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero.**
2. **Take a user’s age as input and display whether they are a minor, adult, or senior citizen.**
3. **Write a program that checks if a given year is a leap year.**
4. **Take an integer and check if it’s even or odd.**
5. **Ask the user for a grade percentage and display the corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, D, F).**
6. **Write a program to find the largest of two numbers.**
7. **Write a program to find the largest of three numbers.**
8. **Create a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome.**

10. **Write a program to determine if a given character is a vowel or consonant.**
11. **Check if a given number is a multiple of both 3 and 5.**
12. **Write a program that takes a temperature in Celsius and checks if it’s freezing, moderate, or hot.**
13. **Take two numbers and an operator (+, -, x, /) as input and perform the corresponding operation.**
14. **Check if a year input by the user is a century year.**
15. **Write a program to check if a number is within a specified range.**
16. **Take the length of three sides and classify the triangle (equilateral, isosceles, or scalene).**
17. **Write a program that asks for an integer and checks if it’s divisible by 2, 3, or both.**
18. **Take a user’s score and determine if they pass or fail (pass if 50 or above).**
19. **Check if a string input is uppercase, lowercase, or a mix.**
20. **Create a program that evaluates if an inputted number is prime (This Logic Can Be Improved)

1. **Print numbers from 1 to 20 using a for loop.**
2. **Use a while loop to print even numbers from 1 to 50.**
3. **Write a program to calculate the sum of all numbers between 1 and 100.**
4. **Print the multiplication table of a given number.**
5. **Print all odd numbers between 1 and 100 using a loop.**
6. **Use a for loop to print each character of a string.**
7. **Find the factorial of a number using a while loop.**
8. **Use a for loop to print numbers from 10 down to 1.**
9. **Write a program to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.** (Interesting Question)
10. **Use a loop to count the number of digits in an integer.**
11. **Print the reverse of a given number.** (Logic can be improved)
12. **Print all prime numbers between 1 and 50.** (Should be done using # Dijkstra's Prime Number Algorithm, thus logic can be improved )
13. **Use nested loops to print a pyramid pattern of `*` (Yet to be done).**
14. **Write a program that breaks the loop when a certain condition is met.**
15. **Print the sum of even and odd numbers separately up to a given number.**
16. **Create a program to calculate the sum of the digits of an inputted integer.**
17. **Write a program that continues to ask for a number until the correct number is guessed.**
18. **Use a loop to print numbers in reverse order within a given range.**
19. **Use a for loop to print the square of each number from 1 to 10.**
20. **Create a program that simulates a countdown timer starting from a given number down to zero.** (Interesting Question)
