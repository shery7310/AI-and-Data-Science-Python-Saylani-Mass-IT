### Python Assignment Questions

This directory contains two parts i.e. Conditional Statements and For Loops. Both these are building blocks of programming concepts. 

These are the books I used to learn and practice these concepts:

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Way-Learn-Python-Remember/dp/1974431479">Smarter Way to Learn Python: # Learn it faster. Remember it longer by Mark Myers</a>

The book is structured with short, digestible chapters that focus on building small concepts. I learned and practiced syntax through each chapter, and the exercises at the end of every section helped me reinforce and improve my understanding of the material. This book had had 4-6 chapters for a small concept i.e if it taught conditionals i had 7 chapters that really taught me in detail.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition/dp/1593279280">Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming by Eric Matthes</a>

After learning and practicing syntax from the first book, I delved deeper into the concepts and theories with this one. It significantly strengthened my programming skills and taught me how to think like a programmer. The book’s practical approach was more detailed than the previous one, and I made sure to take notes in the Obsidian app to reinforce my learning. Mind you Obsidian really is better than many note taking apps and it's better than making notes on register that you would never check again. Here's a guide to obsidian if you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88
