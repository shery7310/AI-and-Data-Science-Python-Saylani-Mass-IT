# AI and Data Science Course by Saylani Mass IT Training Institute (SMIT)

This course is being taught by [Sir Ahmed Jajja](https://github.com/Ahmadjajja) and [this](https://github.com/Ahmadjajja/AI_n_DataScience) is the original repository that my instructor created on 1st of October 2024

This is a course aimed at absolute beginners and I say this as a student of Saylani that it's better than even paid courses by institutes in Pakistan. Saylani is offering this absolutely free, the course is worth hundreds of dollars and they are making careers out of students. The instructor who is the first teacher of this course has been a Section Leader at Standford's code in Place and a number of other international hackathons is determined to make us grind in Leetcode.
