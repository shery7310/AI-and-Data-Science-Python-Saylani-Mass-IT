# Cloning a GitHub Repository (Repo)

When it comes to GitHub a repository or repo means the same thing a repository is like a folder we created online instead of locally.

We can clone a repository by first copying it's URL from the blue code button.
Then in command prompt (cmd) or any terminal we have to type:

`git clone repo URL`

or 

In this case:

`git clone https://github.com/shery7310/AI-and-Data-Science-Python-Saylani-Mass-IT.git`
