### Star and Number Patterns Using Python
Number and Star Patterns help us understand and practice nested loops and we can also get better at dynamic programming using these.
Here we have a number of pattern that one must be able to dry run to get good at loops. Here's how these help:
### 1.  Understanding Nested Loops:

-   **Patterns (Number or Star):**  Creating patterns like stars (`*`) or numbers requires the use of nested loops. Each level of the pattern often corresponds to an outer loop (rows) and an inner loop (columns).
-   Practicing such patterns strengthens your ability to:
    -   Visualize how nested loops interact.
    -   Control the flow of execution in loops.
    -   Manage indices effectively.

### 2.  Dry-Running the Logic:

-   Patterns force you to carefully analyze how variables change at each iteration, encouraging you to dry-run the code mentally or on paper.
-   This practice improves debugging skills and logical thinking, which are critical for writing clean and efficient code.

### 3.  Link to Dynamic Programming (DP):

-   **Pattern Recognition:**  Patterns in star or number problems can help build a mindset for recognizing repetitive sub problems, which is the foundation of dynamic programming.
-   **Loop Optimization:**  Since DP often involves nested loops (e.g., filling out a grid or table), understanding patterns can help you optimize iterations for time and space complexity.

### 4.  Skill Transfer-ability:

-   While star and number patterns may seem trivial, the logic-building process directly translates to real-world scenarios like:
    -   Generating graphical outputs.
    -   Working with matrices and grids.
    -   Designing algorithms for problems in DP, where similar iterations are used.
